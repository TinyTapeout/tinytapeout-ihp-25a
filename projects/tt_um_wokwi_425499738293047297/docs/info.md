## How it works

This project will display a digit 9 if inputs 12567 are true. It will display a dot if the set button is clicked. This project utilizes a half adder on pins OUT4 and OUT5 to prevent both of them from being on at the same time.

## How to test

Just switch the input buttons.

## External hardware

7-segment display.
